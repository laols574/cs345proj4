 * Generic interface for a BST which maps one key type to another (that is,
 * it implements a dictionary-type BST).
 *
 * GENERIC PARAMTERS
 *   K (extends Comparable) - key type.  BSTs will use compareTo() to decide
 *       how to arrange the data.
 *   V - value type.  Can be absolutely *anything*, since we won't call any
 *       methods inside it - however, null is *never* valid, as null is used
 *       in this interface as "not found"
